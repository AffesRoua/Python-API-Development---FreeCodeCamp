# API Development with Python updated version (Based on FreeCodeCamp Tutorial)

I followed the first 11 hours of the [FreeCodeCamp API development tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sOvCWFmrtA&t=41400s) to learn about building APIs with Python. This repository contains my work, which may differ slightly from the tutorial.

Some functions used in the tutorial no longer exist, so I adapted parts of the code while maintaining the original function signatures and outputs. If you're looking for alternative approaches or inspiration beyond the tutorial, you can explore my implementations here.
